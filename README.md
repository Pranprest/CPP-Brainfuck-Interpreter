# C.B.F.I.
A Bad Brain F*ck Interpreter written in C++!
- I (pranprest) don't have any kind of experience with the C++ programing language, so, this project will, most likely, be incredibly bad and un-optimized
- This project was made so that i'd learn a bit better how C++ works! It has already served it's purpose, so maybe i'll not update it that much anymore

But, anyways, please, feel free to send me Issues/Pull requests at any time! I'll try to improve this as much as I can!

## Building
If you have GNU Make on your pc:
run ```make release``` to build the file!  
(or just get a compiled binary directly)

## Running
Run the compiled binary directily w/ whatever brainf*ck file you want to run

```./bfi test.bf```
