# B.B.F.I.
A (very) Bad Brain Fu*ck Interpreter!
- This is just a simple project of a Brain F*ck
- I (pranprest) don't have any kind of experience with the C++ programing language, so, this project will, most likely, be incredily bad and un-optimized

Please, feel free to send me Issues/Pull requests at any time! I'll try to improve this as much as I can!

## Building
If you have GNU Make on your pc:
run ```make``` to build the file!  
(or just compile it directily)

## Running
Run the compiled binary directily w/ whatever brainf*ck file you want to run

```bfi test.bf```

## Notes

- *Please don't let this be in any %PATH% variable - it will most likely break something*
- *This software is licensed with the MIT License, and, as it says, it is distributed AS IS, so, if it breaks something, its your fault!*
